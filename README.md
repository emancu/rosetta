# Rosetta
Rosetta is my [programming chrestomathy][chrestomathy] repository.
The idea is to present solutions to the same task in different languages, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to help me learn new programming languages.

On the 2021, I learnt about [rosettacode][rosettacode] site and I found it fascinating. Then, the idea of doing a repository as a programming language playground was stuck in my head; until today.

# Problems
Only a few simple problems will be listed, not trying to outsmart solutions, just play around with new languages.

## FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).

But:

- for multiples of three, print `Fizz` (instead of the number)
- for multiples of five, print `Buzz` (instead of the number)
- for multiples of both three and five, print `FizzBuzz` (instead of the number)


## FrameIt
Write a function that takes a list of strings an prints them, one per line, in a rectangular frame.

For example the list `["Hello", "World", "in", "a", "frame"]` gets printed as:


    *********
    * Hello *
    * World *
    * in    *
    * a     *
    * frame *
    *********
